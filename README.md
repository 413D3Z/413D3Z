I've recently started working for @AckerWorx - I'm currently studying CyberSecurity as a BaHons Degree. 

I'm a programmer, I wish to learn the industry standard of CyberSecurity so that I may code better.

CyberSecurity is a science, sciences are impossible to master as it constantly evolves. So by that definition, I will always be a student.
